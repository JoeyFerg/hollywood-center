This project tells you your Bacon Number, which is how many degrees away from Kevin Bacon you are.  

So if you were in a Movie with Kevin Bacon, your Bacon Number would be 0. 
If you were in a movie with someone that Kevin Bacon was in a movie with, 
your Bacon Number would be 1, and so on.  

It is said that Kevin Bacon is the center of the Hollywood Universe, and it's a
legend that nobody will have a Bacon number greater than 7.
